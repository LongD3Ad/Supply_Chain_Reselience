st.markdown("""
The grounding of the container ship *Ever Given* in the Suez Canal from March 23 to March 29, 2021,
caused an unprecedented blockage of one of the world's most critical maritime trade routes. This event
sent shockwaves through global supply chains, highlighting their vulnerability to chokepoint disruptions.

# --- Supply Chain Consequences & Implications ---
st.subheader("Supply Chain Consequences")
st.markdown("""
*   **Shipping Delays & Backlogs:** Massive delays on the vital Asia-Europe lane, affecting goods ranging from consumer products to oil. Rerouting around Africa added ~1-2 weeks and significant fuel costs.
*   **Port Congestion:** Delayed vessels arrived at destination ports (e.g., Rotterdam, Felixstowe) in waves, overwhelming capacity and causing further delays.
*   **Increased Freight Costs:** Spot freight rates surged due to the effective reduction in shipping capacity and increased operational costs.
*   **Inventory Strain:** Disrupted Just-In-Time (JIT) systems and depleted buffer stocks for many industries relying on predictable lead times.
*   **Geopolitical & Strategic Reassessment:** Heightened focus on the vulnerability of maritime chokepoints and spurred discussions about alternative routes and supply chain diversification.
