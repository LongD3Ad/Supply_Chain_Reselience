Under normal conditions, supply chains focus on optimizing efficiency, minimizing defects, and maintaining service levels.
These baseline metrics serve as crucial reference points for evaluating performance deviations during disruptions and setting
continuous improvement targets, often guided by methodologies like Lean Six Sigma.

Baseline performance data is fundamental to Lean Six Sigma initiatives, which aim to reduce waste and process variability.
Organizations use these benchmarks to:
*   **Measure Current State:** Understand existing process capabilities (e.g., current sigma level).
*   **Set Improvement Goals:** Define specific, measurable targets (e.g., reduce processing time by 50%).
*   **Track Progress:** Continuously monitor KPIs against the baseline to gauge the effectiveness of improvement efforts.
*   **Strive for Excellence:** Aim for high sigma levels, such as Six Sigma's target of 3.4 Defects Per Million Opportunities (DPMO).
